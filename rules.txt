 - The computer will think of a word or phrase; you have to try to guess what it is, one letter at a time. 

 - The computer will draw a number of dashes equivalent to the number of letters in the word. 

 - If you suggest a letter that occurs in the word, the computer will fill in the blanks with that 
letter in the right place(s). 

 - If the word does not contain the suggested letter, the computer will draw one element of a 
hangmans gallows and the amount of guesses you have left will decrease by one. 

 - As the game progresses, a segment of the gallows and of a victim is added for every suggested 
letter not in the word. Completing a character in a noose provides a minimum of 11 wrong answers 
until the game ends. 

 - If you guess a letter correct, you still have the same number of guesses left as no additional 
lines are added to the hang man

               ...GOOD LUCK
